	Basic Description:
	
		Idea of game is just to stay alive. You start with a small space stations, few credits
		and an ragged asteroid miner. Credits can be used to buy fuel, food, upgrades to ship,
		space suit and space station. Credits can be obtained by mining asteroids and selling
		minerals to shop. Bandits and hazardous environment make mining dangerous.
		
		Main threat of your life on the space station are asteroid that periodicly hammer your 
		space station and bandits trying to steal your goods. You'l have to repair damages that
		asteroid cause by going to out with your space suit. But be aware oxygen and fuel are limited.
		And there might even be some asteroids left.
		
		Shop doesn't always have the same goods. Selection of the shop depends on the suppliers
		of this small partition of space. So make sure to always have some credits in stock so
		that you can make a buy when something interesting comes around.
